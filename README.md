# StoreApp

StoreApp is an e-commerce platform built with React, providing users with a seamless shopping experience. This app fetches products from a mock API and features an interactive cart, allowing users to add items and manage quantities dynamically.

## Features

- **React-Based UI**: Utilizes React for an interactive user experience.
- **Material UI Components**: Offers a modern, responsive design.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Manages global state for cart and product data.
- **API Integration**: Fetches products from a mock API with Axios.
- **Quantity Management**: Users can adjust quantities in the cart.

## How It Works

1. **Product Display**: Products are displayed using Material UI cards, including images, descriptions, and prices.
2. **Adding to Cart**: Users can add items to their cart and modify quantities directly from the product list.
3. **Cart Management**: The cart updates dynamically, with quantity adjustments reflected in the total price.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the interactive UI.
- **Material UI**: For pre-styled components and responsive design.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Manages state for product and cart data.
- **Axios**: Fetches product data from a mock API.

## Installation

1. **Clone** the repository:

2. **Install dependencies**:

3. **Start the app**:
